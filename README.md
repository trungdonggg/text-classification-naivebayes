# Text-classification-naivebayes
    
    The purpose of this project is to make a text sentiment analysis to classify 
    
    articles' subjects.
    
    Given the content and label of articles, we built a model that can effectively 
    
    identify which class the articles should belonged. 



# What is NaiveBayes method?
    
    Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on 
    
    Bayes' theorem. It is commonly used for classification tasks, 
    
    particularly in natural language processing (NLP) for spam filtering, sentiment 
    
    analysis, and document categorization. The "naive" 
    
    assumption in Naive Bayes is that features are conditionally independent given 
    
    the class label, which simplifies the computation.



# Blending model


    In this project, we aim to implement a voting classifier using the RandomForest, 
    
    NaiveBayes, XGBClassifier, and Ridge classifiers to enhance the predictive 
    
    accuracy of our model.
